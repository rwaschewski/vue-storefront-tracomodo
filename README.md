#Tracomodo
Tracomodo is the prototype of a fashion configurator for traditional costumes (bavarian style).
This project is intended as a kind of pitch to convey the idea of the configurator and at the same time serves as the first design draft.

This project is mostly based on [vue-storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/), but only uses a fraction of its functionality at this stage. Instead, the entire configuration process was implemented. 
The products used are based on products of Amazon.de and are linked to the respective product page.

## Run in dev mode
``npm run dev

##Technology
This application is designed as a progressive web app ([PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/))

## The design
The application is prepared to be fully customized in design through theming system.
With the current version we work on raw, basic template of typical eCommerce for a fashion industry.
In the project we used [Material Icons](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).

Here you can read more about the process of [designing PWA for eCommerce](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/designing-pwa-ecommerce-karl-bzik/).

The design is available in open source in the Figma file format under the URL https://www.figma.com/file/VKyqbHFI55TKIKcQlFLiVpVF/Vue-Storefront-Open-Source.

## Other platforms
Vue Storefront is platform agnostic which mean - it can be connected to virtually any CMS. Please take a look at [Pimcore bridge](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/pimcore2vuestorefront) to give you an idea how other platforms can be connected. Any support for integrating Prestashop, Shopify ... - much appreciated.
