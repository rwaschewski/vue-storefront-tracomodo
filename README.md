## Tracomodo
Tracomodo is the prototype of a fashion configurator for traditional costumes (bavarian style).
This project is intended as a kind of pitch to convey the idea of the configurator and at the same time serves as the first design draft.

This project is mostly based on [vue-storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/), but only uses a fraction of its functionality at this stage. Instead, the entire configuration process was implemented. 
The products used are based on products of Amazon.de and are linked to the respective product page.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Technology
This application is designed as a progressive web app ([PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/))
